Convert your WordPress blog into a Flash application - Still in a conception phase

== Description ==

Substitute your worpress theme by a Flash template

* only for Flash enabled browsers and not for search engines
* keep the posts and comments of your WP blog unchanged (database is not modified at all)
* keep the structure of your WP blog: posts, categories, tags, pages, archives, start page...
* keep comments related functionnalities
* use WP URL rewrite and adds a deep linking system
* choose one of the included Flash templates
* create your own dynamic Flash templates with Silex WYSIWYG

This plug-in is SEO friendly and makes use of [Silex the #1 opensource Flash CMS](http://silex-ria.org/ "Silex project website"), to build dynamic Flash templates without the Flash IDE. These templates can display your blog data, the posts, pages and comments. And you will be able to modify the appearance in [Silex WYSIWYG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFqfuiLQ4k&hl=fr "Silex WYSIWYG video demo").

[Sha](http://silex-ria.org/sha "Sha cv") has allready done [a website with Silex driven by WordPress](http://flashcms.fr/ "flashcms, a Silex-WP site (in French)"). And [here is a video of an other test I did](http://www.screentoaster.com/watch/stUkxdQ0VLR15cR19dU1le "Silex Wordpress video")). These prototypes are not SEO friendly and a classical WordPress blog could not be converted easily. 

Now I want this plugin to make Silex a Flash equivalent of a WordPress blog.
 
== Installation ==

Upload the 1silex4wp plugin to your blog, Activate it, choose your Flash template. You are done, Your blog is in Flash
