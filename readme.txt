Convert your WordPress blog into a Flash application

== Description ==

*Still in a conception phase - Nothing to download yet - see [the screenshots of the prototypes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/1silex4wp/screenshots/ "screenshots")*

**Substitute your worpress theme by a Flash template**

* visible only by Flash enabled browsers - *search engines or phones will see your blog normally*
* keeps the *posts and comments* of your WP blog unchanged. The database is not modified at all. Keeps comments related functionnalities.
* keeps *the structure of your WP blog*: posts, categories, tags, pages, archives, start page...
* use WP URL rewrite and adds a *deep linking system*
* choose one of the *included Flash templates*
* create your own dynamic Flash templates with *Silex WYSIWYG*

This plug-in is SEO friendly and makes use of [Silex the #1 opensource Flash CMS](http://silex-ria.org/ "Silex project website"), to build dynamic Flash templates without the Flash IDE. These templates can display your blog data, the posts, pages and comments. And you will be able to modify the appearance in [Silex WYSIWYG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFqfuiLQ4k&hl=fr "Silex WYSIWYG video demo").

[Sha](http://silex-ria.org/sha "Sha cv") has allready done [a website with Silex driven by WordPress](http://flashcms.fr/ "flashcms, a Silex-WP site (in French)"). And [here is a video of an other test I did](http://www.screentoaster.com/watch/stUkxdQ0VLR15cR19dU1le "Silex Wordpress video")). These prototypes are not SEO friendly and a classical WordPress blog could not be converted easily. 

Now I want this plugin to make Silex a Flash equivalent of a WordPress blog.
