== Description ==

**Provide your visitors a Flash equivalent of your website / Convert your WordPress blog into a Flash application.**

* visible only by Flash enabled browsers - *search engines or portable phones will see your blog theme*
* keeps the *posts and comments* of your WP blog unchanged. The database is not modified at all. Keeps comments related functionnalities.
* keeps *the structure of your WP blog*: posts, categories, tags, pages, archives, start page...
* use WP URL rewrite and adds a *deep linking system*
* choose one of the *included Flash templates*
* create your own dynamic Flash templates with *Silex WYSIWYG*

**Notes**

* Currently in alpha version - Work is in progress, v1.0beta1 is comming in July *
* For now, look at [the screenshots of the prototypes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/1silex4wp/screenshots/ "screenshots")
* [Work in progress can be seen here](http://hoyau.info/demos/1silex4wp/ "Work in progress can be seen here")

**Description**

1silex4wp is SEO friendly and makes use of [Silex the #1 opensource Flash CMS](http://silex-ria.org/ "Silex project website"), to build dynamic Flash templates without the Flash IDE. These templates can display your blog data, the posts, pages and comments. And you will be able to modify the appearance in [Silex WYSIWYG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFqfuiLQ4k&hl=fr "Silex WYSIWYG video demo").

[Sha](http://silex-ria.org/sha "Sha cv") has allready done [a website with Silex driven by WordPress](http://flashcms.fr/ "flashcms, a Silex-WP site (in French)"). And [here is a video of an other test I did](http://www.screentoaster.com/watch/stUkxdQ0VLR15cR19dU1le "Silex Wordpress video")). These prototypes are not SEO friendly and a classical WordPress blog could not be converted easily. 

Now I want 1silex4wp to let Silex themes be Flash equivalents of WordPress themes.
 
== Installation ==

Upload the 1silex4wp plugin to your blog, Activate it, choose your Flash template. You are done, Your blog is in Flash

Requirements

* php5
* WP 2.x

== Screenshots ==

1. Flash version of WordPress default theme
2. One of the Silex templates for WordPress
3. Silex WYSIWYG used to make Flash templates without the Flash IDE
